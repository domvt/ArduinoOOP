# ArduinoOOP
This is an Arduino-based project that will follow my progression learning C++ (on the Arduino IDE and otherwise) with a goal of proficiency in object-oriented programming for mechatronics engineering. I will start by building an 'mp3 player' with Adafruit components and program the software to read data from a TF card and output audio using Bluetooth low-energy protocals.
